* TODO [#B] Nix modify $package

* TODO [#B] Zilch should work as project-local or user-local scope
- Looks for a zilch toml in ., .., ../..
- Have a ZILCH_PATH, which defaults to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zilch/
- Have a --path which overrides ZILCH_PATH

* TODO [#B] Direnv Zilch integration

* TODO [#A] zilch activate (mutate current environment)

* DONE [#A] zilch install

* DONE [#A] zilch search prettiness

* TODO [#B] Figure out how to pin nixpkgs

* TODO [#C] Work for cross-compilation

* TODO [#B] Make info not lie
If a package is present in TOML but not installed, don't show it

* TODO [#B] Make info not lie
Put versions in nix list

* TODO [#B] Aptitude-like TUI
- Shows a list installed packages and sources
- I to install package
  - search by keywords
  - Prompt for source, defaults to source=Nixpkgs
  - Prompts for version, defaults to version=${latest}
- D to remove a package
- U to upgrade a package
  - Defaults to version=${latest}

* TODO [#B] Use Nix-output-manager

* TODO [#B] Use verbose or debug flags

* TODO [#B] Design Python APi to be independent of CLI
- Someone should be able to use the Python API to manage a Nix flake without zilch.toml
- Someone should be able to use the Python API to manage zilch.toml without using CLI

* TODO [#C] When no package matches, we should offer suggestions based on Levenshtein distance

* TODO [#C] Read zilch.toml from Flake

* TODO [#C] Separate sources from packages in zilch.toml

* TODO [#C] Zilch should have an option to use the flake in the current directory

* TODO [#C] Find a way for Rich to output JSON instead of UI based on isattty/cmd flag

* TODO [#C] Prompt user for arguments if they were not given
